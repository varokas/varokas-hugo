Since I've lived in Seattle for a while. People asked me what are some of the things they should do if they fly there to visit. Never realized Seattle is quite a popular place to be in. So I decided to compile a list for that.

Obviously this is my heavily biased opinion. Seattle's a great city (especially so if you like nature and hiking). To reduce down to just one item for each category turns out to be really hard.

But here they are. The list of the very best that Seattle has to offer.

## City View

A postcard view of Seattle is at [Kerry Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kerry+Park/@47.629547,-122.360137,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x33f7681e2424b58e). It's not really is a park, but a small sightseeing spot overlook the whole city. It will look pretty day or night. On a clear day, you will also see Mount Rainier on the back.



## Hiking

I went to [Rattlesnake Ledge](http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/rattle-snake-ledge) at least 10 times literally. And would never mind do more. This is my happy place to be in Seattle. It will only take at most 1 hour to go up. It is only moderately steep (1160 ft) but the view is serene and totally worth it. There might be a hiking trail with more beautiful view. But this one is the best given how close it is to the city (50 min) and how rewarding it is to be there.

When you are up there, don't forgot to look to your left and find a parking lot with a tiny dot that is your car which is very satisfying.



## Food



[![l-2](/images/2015/03/l-21.jpg)](/images/2015/03/l-21.jpg)

Salmon here is the greatest. Any decent restaurants in town will know how not to mess up a good ingredient. It's a good sign when you can order different type of Salmon in the menu.

If you need a name, then let's go to [Ivar’s Salmon House](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ivars-salmon-house-seattle). Apart from good and relatively inexpensive food, you get a killer view of Lake Union. Ask for a window table at reservation. It's not that hard to get one. And smoked salmon chowder is unforgettable.



## Dessert

Seattle does not have really good dessert spot. But the El Diablo  at [Tango](http://tangorestaurant.com) is the best chocolate terrine man ever made. The food is so-so but the terrine is worth going there just to eat the dessert. Plus, they open till 11pm.



## Coffee Shop



[![l-3](/images/2015/03/l-3.jpg)](/images/2015/03/l-3.jpg)

Seattle's is [the most caffeinated city in USA](http://www.cnbc.com/id/43896943/page/13). And we love to caffeinated ourselves in style. The city is swamped with all cute laid back coffee shops. But I'd pick [Fremont Coffee](http://www.yelp.com/biz/fremont-coffee-seattle) as a place to be. It's basically a house turned into a small coffee place. And the coffee there is great. This perfectly captures the vibe of having a cup of coffee in Seattle really meant to be.



## Nature



[![10622917_10152801914098690_6949598933366306589_n](/images/2015/03/10622917_10152801914098690_6949598933366306589_n.jpg)](/images/2015/03/10622917_10152801914098690_6949598933366306589_n.jpg)

[Mount Rainier](http://www.nps.gov/mora/index.htm) is Seattle's icon as it has every right to be. It's beautiful. It's close (< 2 hrs drive). And hiking really is optional. If this is your first time, go to Paradise Point. It's beautiful up close as it is for afar. Only drawback is it is seasonal. Only visit in Summer or Fall time.



## Tourist Spot



[![l](/images/2015/03/l1.jpg)](/images/2015/03/l1.jpg)

Everybody stops by at [Pike Place Market](http://www.yelp.com/biz/pike-place-market-seattle). And honestly it's not that bad of a place compared to other tourist traps. It captures Seattle life quite well. Laid back, close to nature and sincere. Check it out.



## Local Chill out



[![ballard_locks_small_east](/images/2015/03/ballard_locks_small_east-1024x707.jpg)](/images/2015/03/ballard_locks_small_east.jpg)

Hiram M. Chittenden Locks AKA [Ballard Locks](http://www.yelp.com/biz/hiram-m-chittenden-locks-seattle) AKA the Salmon ladder place. It's a nice area where you can hangout and look at salmon jumping over a fish ladder. Again it's seasonal (check first). Salmon may not be there all the time but the area is nice all year round.

## Misc Tips







  * Sockeye Salmon has red meat by nature. Don't be alarmed. They tasted really good. In matter of fact, try all type of salmons while you're here


  * There's nothing to see up top of Space Needle, no need to go up there.


  * Bainbridge Island is a bit overrated. The ferry view is super-nice, but there's nothing to do on the island


  * Leavenworth is nice, but not worth 2 hrs drive. If you want to see German town, better visit Germany


  * Point Defiance Park Zoo has Polar Bears !


  * Best Pasta I had in my Life: Il Corvo


  * Other restaurants to consider (fine dining) : Matts in the Market, Zoe, Tanaka San, Serious Pie


  * First Starbuck shop is so-so, visit it while you were at Pike Place market. But don't miss the Starbucks Reserve Tasting Room.


  * Fun Fact: Seattle city today is built on top of a burnt down city. If that intrigued you, take the underground tour to see the underground level of Seattle. There's not much to see, but looking up at people walking on the street is pretty cool.


  * Another park worth visiting : Olympic National Park
