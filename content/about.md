## Projects
The best way to learn is by creating a safe environment to play, jumping into it, look at your mistakes and think about how to do better next time. These are community projects I initiated with software practitioners in Thailand on applications of Agile.

### Agile Thailand & Agile Tour Bangkok Conferences

![ATH](/images/2014/06/ath2013.jpg)I helped initiate and facilitate Thailand's first and only national Agile conference series. All events are organized with Agile process and regular retrospective. Staff learned Agile planning, tracking and retrospective through organizing these events.

### Scrum Primer Translation

## HuskyCode

"Practice Agile methods in safe environments via online projects that help software community." During the time HuskyCode was founded, there were unbelievably low number of Agile adoptions in Thailand and a place to safely practice these skills is non-existent. So I founded HuskyCode for all Agile enthusiast to meet and develop their skills in working together as a team. How to slice and negotiate the stories with product owners. How to deliver value incrementally to an online community project. These are the projects developed under HuskyCode.
